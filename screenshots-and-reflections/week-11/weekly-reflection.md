#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

Share your resources here. Example: "When completing Lab 2, I used this [stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28177370/how-to-format-localdate-to-string), to format the date.   

I also got stuck with a corrupt commit error message: 
			
			error: inflate: data stream error (incorrect header check)
			error: corrupt loose object '5cdeb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a'
			fatal: loose object 5cdeb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a (stored in .git/objects/5c/deb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a) 
			
Curtis, the IT Guide, helped me resolve it by using [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12571557/fixing-a-corrupt-loose-object-as-a-commit-in-git).

If you didn't use any additional resources or receive any outside help, then indicate that as such. Example: "I did not use any outside resources on any parts of this submission - the work is entirely my own."

Replace this text and the examples above with your own references.
